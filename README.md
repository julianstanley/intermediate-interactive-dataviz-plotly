# Intermediate interactive dataviz with plotly

This is just a personal repository. I'm working on the "Intermediate Interactive Data Visualization with Plotly" [course in datacamp](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-interactive-data-visualization-with-plotly-in-r) and am putting my work and solutions here.

I render my solutions, but the rendering isn't great--I use knitr::spin instead of properly rendering.

The dataset also don't always match the course's. A few of the datasets aren't available for public download, so I sometimes found and cleaned public datasets to use.

As always, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
